Information Security Analyst Summary:

The current trust model for SSL certificates is flawed due to the reliance on a single Certificate Authority (CA) to sign X.509 certificates. Verisign, the dominant CA, has made a significant error by issuing two fraudulent certificates to someone claiming to be from Microsoft. This incident highlights the inherent risks in the current system, as these certificates could be used to sign malicious programs, ActiveX controls, and Office macros.

Furthermore, the lack of proper implementation of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and CRL Distribution Points (CDPs) by CAs and software vendors makes it difficult to revoke compromised certificates effectively. Until CAs invest in building robust CDP infrastructure and software vendors enable certificate revocation checks by default, the situation is unlikely to improve. Users are not expected to demand these features, allowing CAs to perpetuate the myth that certificates are reliable for secure transactions and contracts.

Douglas Adams-style Summary:

In the grand scheme of things, the universe of SSL certificates is a bit like the Vogon bureaucracy: a convoluted mess of trust and authority that's about as reliable as a drunken Zaphod Beeblebrox at the helm of the Heart of Gold. You see, when Alice wants to have a chat with Bob, they both have to trust a central authority - a Certificate Authority (CA) - to verify that they are who they claim to be. It's like having the Galactic President sign off on your identity, except there's no Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters involved.

Now, imagine if the Galactic President started handing out fake IDs to any Vogon who claimed to be from Microsoft. That's exactly what happened when Verisign, the big cheese of CAs, issued two fraudulent certificates to an imposter. It's like giving the keys to the Improbability Drive to a Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.

To make matters worse, the Galactic President didn't bother to tell anyone which IDs were fake, because apparently, keeping a list of revoked certificates is too much trouble. It's like trying to find a decent cup of tea in the depths of space. And don't even get me started on the software vendors who can't be bothered to check if a certificate has been revoked. It's like having a Babel Fish that only translates into Vogon poetry.

In the end, it seems that trusting SSL certificates is about as sensible as putting a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias in charge of your online security. But don't panic! Just remember to bring your towel and hope for the best.
