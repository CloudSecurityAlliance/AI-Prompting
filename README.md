# AI-Prompting

This is broken into directories for various projects using AI prompting. Some of the directories may include scripts, please ensuire any API tokens are set using environmental variables so you don't leak them here.

Most files will be append logs so you can easily view the previous prompts and strategies used.

## Utilities

The utilities assume a system with Python3 and Bash present, so Linux or Mac OS (if you're on WIndows use WSL2/Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store like Kurt does).
